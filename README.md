Python 2.7 (NOT Python 3.??)  o	The code is written in Python 2.7. If you want to use 3.?? You?ll need to parse the code, though.o	?pip? should be install at the same time (included in newer versions of Python). You?ll need it to install some packages with the help of ?pip?later.Python-packages:o	Just use the requirements.txt to install all the needed stuff.o	Not A Must: Virtual Environment for Python for those who want to stay clean.Which Software do you need in addition??

Pip:o	HTML resource: ?  https://www.python.org/downloads/?	It already comes with the installation of any Python2 above 2.7.9.?	If you really want to use an older version of Python, here are the instructions given: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/?	3.	MySQL:o	HTML resource (basic): https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/o	HTML resource (connector-python): https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/ ?	OR via pip in the command line: pip install mysql-connector 4.	Git:o	HTML resource: https://git-scm.com/downloads ?	Choose ?Windows? below downloads and that?s it. Just install it and use Git-Bash to use the terminal for your git-work.Linux:1.	Python:o	HTML resource: not need, comes with Linux already, use terminal for further operations:i.	Check Python installation (in terminal): $ python --versionii.	If it is above 2.7.9, you are good. Pip is already installediii.	If you are below 2.7.9 you have to update to a newer version:?	Remove the old one: $ sudo apt-get remove python2.?your version in here??	Install the new one: $ sudo apt-get install python2.7 2.	Pip:o	HTML resource: see 1. Python ?3.

Git clone https://github.com/MarcusGrum/OpenDarkness-Tool.gitLast but not least:Use ?pip? to install all the requirements, hence packages, for your Python to be able to run the code and use it.Just execute the following command inside the terminal/command line:pip install -r requirements.txtWhat If I want to use a ?virtual environment? for my code?Well, then do it! You got almost all tools to be able to do that. You just need to install ?virtual environment? over ?pip? and then follow one of instructions given respectively for your operating system.HTML resource (one of many): ?	Installation: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ ?
